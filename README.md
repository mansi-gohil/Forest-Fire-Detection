# WildfireWatch | IOT and ML based Forest Fire Detection 


Forest fire detection systems are gaining a lot of attention because of the continual threat from fire to both economic properties and public safety. Hundreds of millions of hectares are destroyed by wildfires each year and over 200,000 forest fires happen every year in the world. Forest fires destroy a total area of 3.5 to 4.5 million sq km. Increase in forest fires in forest areas around the world has resulted in an increased motivation for developing fire warning systems for the early detection of wildfires. Sensor technology has been widely used in fire detection, usually depending on sensing physical parameters such as changes in pressure, humidity, and temperature, as well as chemical parameters such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. However, it is hard to apply these systems in large open areas for a variety of reasons such as high cost, energy usage by the sensors, and the necessary proximity of the sensor to the fire for accurate sensing resulting in physical damage to the sensors.

# Aim & Objectives 

- Forest fires are common hazards in forests that cause a lot of harm to Wildlife as well as the Environment.
- It could be avoided if a robust system could be deployed in forest areas to detect the fire and alert the Fire extinguishing authority to take immediate action.
- In this project, the intention is to build a Forest fire detection System using IoT and Machine Learning which would detect the fire and send an emergency alert to the Authority.
- The main goal is to detect if there is a fire taking place or predict whether a fire will be occurring in the near future.

## Conclusion 

In the case of forest fire detection IOT removes the difficulty faced in traditional methods like man standing on a tower and monitoring the environment. All the data in the dataset has to be aggregated to reach the result so it is done by using tree based and cluster based methods. Forest Fire can also be predicted using IoT with the help of DHT11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity levels.
